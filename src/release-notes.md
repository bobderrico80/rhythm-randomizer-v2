## What's New in Version 2.2.0?

Playback functionality! This oft-requested feature is finally available! Click the 'Play' button in the header navigation area to start playback. Note heads and rests will highlight along with the playback.

The settings menu now contains a new section for adjusting playback settings including both the tempo and the pitch of the playback tone.

The 'Share Settings' button also shares the current pitch and tempo settings allowing easy sharing and saving of the playback settings in addition to other settings.

## What's New in Version 2.1.2?

- Fixed broken time signature icons

## What's New in Version 2.1.1?

- Security updates

## What's New in Version 2.1.0?

### 'Share Settings' functionality

This update adds a 'Share Settings' button to the settings menu. Clicking this button will copy a share link to the clipboard. This share link is encoded with all of the current score settings, allowing you to easily share the current score configuration with another user.

This feature is useful for sharing specific configurations with different groups of people. For example, a teacher might want to post a link to similar rhythms for younger students, and more complicated rhythms for older students.

Another useful way to use this feature is to bookmark share links. This allows users to quickly get back to a specific configuration.

### Other updates

- Improved keyboard accessibility

## What's New in Version 2.0.3?

- Fixed issue of the app not loading on older versions of Safari (below version 14)
- Ensured that when an error occurs, users are not presented with a blank screen, but with an error message containing a link to the Facebook page.

## What's New in Version 2.0.2?

- Increased maximum width of score, which inherently increases the size of the notation and more closely mimics the look of the version 1 site.
- Increased the size of the header buttons on mobile

## What's New in Version 2.0.1?

- Fixed bug where main menu could be scrolled into view on mobile devices
- Added Google Analytics tracking script
- Setup a link to the "old" Rhythm Randomizer: [http://v1.rhythmrandomizer.com](http://v1.rhythmrandomizer.com)

## What's New in Version 2.0.0?

Welcome to Rhythm Randomizer version 2! This version is a complete rebuild of the original version that was created in 2014, and hasn't been updated since. This new version is more stable, easier to maintain, and easier to update and add new features. There are many exciting features planned for version 2. Be sure to check the main menu for news about updates and new features, or even better, follow my [Facebook Page](https://fb.me/TheRhythmRandomizer)!

Here are some of the new things introduced with this version:

### New user interface

All configuration options are now located in the left slide-out pane, which can be accessed by clicking or tapping the gear icon on the left. A main menu slide-out is available on the right, and for now will feature release notes, contact information, and version information.

A toolbar now exists in the header, and currently just has a button to generate a new rhythm, but keep an eye on this area of the app, as new features will be added here in the future!

The main score area is now less cluttered, with the options hidden away in the slide-out.

### New note rendering engine

The Rhythm Randomizer now uses [VexFlow](https://www.vexflow.com/) for rendering music notation. This improved note rendering API will make it much easier to add other score elements aside from basic notation to generated rhythms.

### Syncopated note combinations

Three new note selections have been added for 8th-quarter-8th syncopated rhythms.

### Persistent options

Selected options will now be persisted locally. This means that if you close the browser tab or refresh the page, the options (selected notes, time signature, and measure count) will remain the same, rather than resetting to the default as before.

### New Facebook page

During the last six years, I've had several people attempt to reach out to me about feature requests and bug fixes. Since I created this project (and in all honesty, kinda forgot about it), the email address was outdated. Most people were able to track me down on Facebook. In the future, I want to make this process easier, so I've set up a dedicated [Facebook page](https://fb.me/TheRhythmRandomizer) for The Rhythm Randomizer. Follow the page to get news about updates and post feedback, feature requests, or bugs that you might find.

### Thank you!

Lastly, I want to say thank you to those who are still making use of this tool, and are finding it useful, whether on their own or in their classrooms. I built the original version of The Rhythm Randomizer in 2014 while I was still teaching music. I built it because I couldn't find a similar tool, and felt I had the technical knowledge to build it myself. This project helped me discover my love and passion for web development and software engineering, and helped launch a whole new career in that field.

While I had mostly forgotten about the project after I stopped teaching, I was always excited when someone would reach out with feature requests or bug reports, and was touched to know that others were finding this tool useful.

With the global pandemic sending many music teachers to have to adapt to virtual instruction, I felt that The Rhythm Randomizer would fit nicely into that commitment, and decided to dust it off again and clean it up. I have lots of ideas for new features that I'll be adding in the coming months. Please also continue to send me your feedback, and let me know how you are using The Rhythm Randomizer! Thank you!!

~ Bob
